                name: "Ruth",
                date: "c. 1100 BC",
                scripture: "Ruth 1:1-4:22",
                intro: "A Moabite woman who demonstrates extraordinary loyalty and faith. After her husband's death, she chooses to follow Naomi and the God of Israel rather than return to her own people. Her faithfulness leads to her becoming the great-grandmother of King David and an ancestor of Christ.",
                tagline: "Faithful daughter-in-law, ancestor of Christ",
                summary: "Ruth is a Moabite woman who marries Mahlon, one of Naomi's sons. When her husband, brother-in-law, and father-in-law all die, Naomi encourages Ruth and her sister-in-law Orpah to return to their Moabite families. Orpah returns, but Ruth clings to Naomi, declaring her famous words: 'Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.' Ruth's commitment to Naomi and to the God of Israel demonstrates remarkable faith and loyalty. She accompanies Naomi back to Bethlehem, where she gleans in the fields of Boaz, a relative of Naomi's deceased husband. Boaz shows kindness to Ruth, and she eventually becomes his wife. Through their marriage, Ruth gives birth to Obed, who becomes the father of Jesse, who becomes the father of David. Ruth's story demonstrates that God's grace extends to all who believe, regardless of their background. As a Moabite, she was outside the covenant people, but through faith, she becomes part of the line of Christ. Ruth's faithfulness points forward to how we, as Gentiles, are brought into God's family through faith in Christ. Her inclusion in the genealogy of Christ (Matthew 1:5) shows that God's plan of redemption includes all who believe, regardless of their past or background."

                name: "Naomi",
                date: "c. 1100 BC",
                scripture: "Ruth 1:1-4:22",
                intro: "A woman who experiences great loss but finds redemption through God's providence. Her bitterness turns to joy as God provides a kinsman-redeemer for her family line.",
                tagline: "From bitterness to blessing",
                summary: "Naomi, whose name means 'pleasant,' experiences great tragedy when she, her husband Elimelech, and their two sons move to Moab during a famine. While in Moab, her husband dies, and her two sons marry Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. Then both sons die, leaving Naomi with no husband and no sons. Naomi decides to return to Bethlehem, and she encourages her daughters-in-law to return to their families. Orpah returns, but Ruth insists on staying with Naomi. When they arrive in Bethlehem, Naomi tells the women there to call her 'Mara' (bitter) instead of Naomi, saying, 'The Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty.' However, through God's providence, Ruth meets Boaz, a relative who can act as a kinsman-redeemer. Through Boaz's redemption of the family line, Naomi finds joy again. When Ruth gives birth to Obed, the women say to Naomi, 'Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel! He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.' Naomi's story demonstrates how God can turn bitterness into blessing and how He provides for His people even in their darkest moments. Her story points forward to how God provides redemption for us through Christ, our ultimate Kinsman-Redeemer."

                name: "Boaz",
                date: "c. 1100 BC",
                scripture: "Ruth 2:1-4:22",
                intro: "A wealthy landowner who acts as a kinsman-redeemer, demonstrating God's provision and pointing forward to Christ, our ultimate Redeemer.",
                tagline: "Kinsman-redeemer, type of Christ",
                summary: "Boaz is a wealthy landowner from Bethlehem and a relative of Naomi's deceased husband Elimelech. When Ruth comes to glean in his fields, Boaz shows her extraordinary kindness, instructing his workers to leave extra grain for her and ensuring her safety. Boaz recognizes Ruth's loyalty to Naomi and her faith in the God of Israel. When Naomi instructs Ruth to approach Boaz at the threshing floor to request that he act as a kinsman-redeemer, Boaz agrees but notes that there is a closer relative who has first right to redeem. Boaz handles the situation with integrity, approaching the closer relative first. When that relative declines to redeem because it would endanger his own estate, Boaz redeems the family property and marries Ruth. Through their marriage, Boaz and Ruth have a son, Obed, who becomes the grandfather of King David. Boaz's role as kinsman-redeemer points forward to Christ, who redeems us from sin and death. Just as Boaz redeemed Ruth and Naomi's family line, Christ redeems us and brings us into God's family. Boaz's kindness, integrity, and willingness to redeem demonstrate the character of our ultimate Redeemer, Jesus Christ."

                tagline: "The provider and redeemer, working behind the scenes",
                summary: "Throughout the book of Ruth, the Lord works providentially behind the scenes. He ends the famine in Bethlehem, prompting Naomi to return. He guides Ruth to glean in Boaz's field. He provides Boaz as a kinsman-redeemer. He blesses Ruth and Boaz with a son, Obed, who becomes part of the line of David and ultimately the line of Christ. The Lord's providence in Ruth demonstrates that He is always at work, even when we cannot see it. He uses ordinary people and ordinary circumstances to accomplish His extraordinary purposes. The book of Ruth shows that God's plan of redemption includes all who believe, regardless of their background. Ruth, a Moabite, becomes part of the line of Christ through God's grace.
