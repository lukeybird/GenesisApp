                name: "David",
                date: "c. 1010-970 BC",
                scripture: "2 Samuel 1:1-24:25",
                intro: "David becomes king over all Israel and establishes Jerusalem as his capital. His reign includes both great victories and tragic failures, demonstrating that even godly kings are flawed and need a perfect King.",
                tagline: "King of Israel, man after God's heart",
                summary: "After Saul's death, David becomes king over Judah, then over all Israel. He captures Jerusalem and makes it his capital, bringing the ark of the covenant there. God makes an eternal covenant with David, promising that his kingdom will endure forever. However, David commits adultery with Bathsheba and arranges for her husband Uriah to be killed. When the prophet Nathan confronts him, David repents. Despite his failures, God forgives him and continues to use him. David's life demonstrates both the heights of faith and the depths of sin, pointing forward to our need for a perfect King who never fails—Christ, the Son of David who perfectly obeyed and reigns forever."

                name: "Bathsheba",
                date: "c. 1000 BC",
                scripture: "2 Samuel 11:1-12:25",
                intro: "The wife of Uriah the Hittite, with whom David commits adultery. Through repentance and God's grace, she becomes the mother of Solomon and an ancestor of Christ.",
                tagline: "From sin to grace, mother of Solomon",
                summary: "Bathsheba is the wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of David's mighty men. While Uriah is away at war, David sees Bathsheba bathing and commits adultery with her. When she becomes pregnant, David arranges for Uriah to be killed in battle. After Uriah's death, David marries Bathsheba, but their first child dies as a consequence of their sin. However, God shows grace, and Bathsheba gives birth to Solomon, who becomes the next king. Bathsheba is listed in the genealogy of Christ (Matthew 1:6), showing that God's grace extends even through the consequences of sin. Her story points forward to how God uses imperfect people in His redemptive plan, ultimately fulfilled in Christ."

                name: "Nathan",
                date: "c. 1000 BC",
                scripture: "2 Samuel 7:1-17, 12:1-25",
                intro: "The prophet who confronts David about his sin with Bathsheba and delivers God's promise of an eternal kingdom through David's line.",
                tagline: "Prophet of confrontation and promise",
                summary: "Nathan is a prophet who serves during David's reign. He delivers God's promise to David that his kingdom will endure forever, pointing forward to Christ. When David sins with Bathsheba, Nathan courageously confronts him with a parable, leading David to repentance. Nathan's role as a prophet who speaks truth to power points forward to how the prophets spoke truth to Israel, and ultimately to how Christ, the ultimate Prophet, speaks truth to us. Nathan's message of both judgment and grace foreshadows the gospel, where we face judgment for our sin but receive grace through Christ."

                name: "Absalom",
                date: "c. 990-970 BC",
                scripture: "2 Samuel 13:1-18:33",
                intro: "David's son who rebels against his father and attempts to seize the throne. His rebellion and death demonstrate the consequences of sin and the pain it causes.",
                tagline: "Rebellious son, tragic end",
                summary: "Absalom is David's son, known for his beauty and charm. After his sister Tamar is violated by their half-brother Amnon, Absalom kills Amnon and flees. When he returns, he gradually wins the hearts of the people and leads a rebellion against David. Absalom's rebellion causes David to flee Jerusalem, but ultimately Absalom is defeated and killed. David mourns deeply for his son, saying, 'O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you.' Absalom's story demonstrates the consequences of sin and the pain it causes in families. It also points forward to how we, as God's children, can rebel against our Father, but He still loves us and grieves over our sin, just as David grieved over Absalom."

This Davidic covenant points forward to Christ, the ultimate Son of David who reigns forever.
